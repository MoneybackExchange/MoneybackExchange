MONEYBACK, is a project about the 
generation of a Mixed brand for 
a Decentralized Non-Governmental 
Organization, which implements Quality 
Self-Management programs in Rural, 
Neighborhood and Indigenous communities.
It is monetized through the gamification 
of the programs we run, aiming towards 
sustainability and scalability. We 
generate value, on the one hand, for the 
public sector through the integration of 
technologies for the traceable management 
of operations and monitoring of sustainable 
projects. 

In the case of the private sector, the 
generation of pieces of digital information 
that can be monetized according to their 
business strategies, scalable in their 
social contributions. What on the one hand 
gives a tax exemption for companies, is 
paid back to the state in the billing of 
the results of the communities.
